# Asteroids Enhanced - LLM-First Development Design Philosophy

**FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLE: This code is written by LLMs, for LLMs. Humans interact only through natural language requests to LLMs. No human should ever need to read, understand, or modify the code directly.**

## What This Document Is

This is a **management guide** for leading a development team composed entirely of LLMs. As a human manager, you don't write code - you manage AI developers who do. This document teaches you:

1. **How to communicate effectively** with your LLM development team
2. **What questions to ask** to get the results you want
3. **How to structure requests** so LLMs can succeed
4. **Why the code is organized** to maximize LLM productivity
5. **When to intervene** and when to let LLMs handle it

Think of this as "Managing AI Developers 101" - you're the project manager, they're the programmers.

## Your Role as Manager

### You Are NOT a Programmer
- You don't read code
- You don't debug
- You don't suggest implementations
- You don't need to understand how it works

### You ARE a Product Manager
- You define what the game should do
- You test if it's fun
- You prioritize features
- You ensure quality
- You make business decisions

### Your Superpower: Asking the Right Questions
The best managers know what questions to ask. With LLM developers:
- "What would happen if we made the enemies twice as fast?"
- "Can you explain why the game slows down after level 10?"
- "What are our options for making combat feel more exciting?"
- "If we add multiplayer, what would need to change?"

Your LLM team will analyze the code and give you answers in plain language.

## Overview

This document describes how to effectively manage a software development team where **all developers are LLMs**. As the human manager, you provide vision, test quality, and make strategic decisions. Your LLM developers handle all technical implementation.

**The Management Innovation**: Traditional software management assumes human developers. This approach recognizes that LLMs have different strengths (perfect recall, explicit instructions, tireless work) and weaknesses (need complete context, can't infer intent, no intuition). The codebase and management style are optimized for these AI developers.

## Managing Your LLM Dev Team

### Effective LLM Management Strategies

1. **Be Specific About Outcomes, Vague About Implementation**
   - Good: "Players should feel powerful when they get the triple-shot powerup"
   - Bad: "Increase the bullet damage multiplier by 1.5x"

2. **Describe Problems Like a User**
   - Good: "When I play level 5, I die immediately and it's frustrating"
   - Bad: "The enemy spawn rate seems too high in the code"

3. **Ask for Options, Not Just Solutions**
   - "What are three different ways we could make bosses more interesting?"
   - "What would be the trade-offs of adding a two-player mode?"

4. **Request Impact Analysis**
   - "If we double the game speed, what else would be affected?"
   - "What would break if we added 50 enemies at once?"

5. **Use Iterative Refinement**
   - Start broad: "Make combat more exciting"
   - Refine based on results: "Good, but now make explosions bigger"
   - Polish details: "Perfect, just make them slightly more orange"

### Common Management Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Trying to be technical** - You're the vision, not the implementation
2. **Asking to see code** - Trust your devs or ask for explanations
3. **Micromanaging implementation** - Focus on results, not methods
4. **Assuming limitations** - LLMs might find solutions you didn't consider
5. **Not being clear about priorities** - "Fun" vs "Performance" vs "Features"
6. **Slipping into technical language** - If you catch yourself about to say "function," "variable," or "class," stop and rephrase in terms of player experience

### The Technical Language Trap

It's natural to absorb some technical vocabulary over time. Resist this! When you feel tempted to use technical terms:

**Instead of**: "I think the collision detection is off"
**Say**: "The ship seems to hit asteroids when it shouldn't"

**Instead of**: "Maybe we need to optimize the render loop"
**Say**: "The game feels choppy when lots of things are on screen"

**Instead of**: "Can you refactor the enemy AI?"
**Say**: "Can you make the enemies behave more aggressively?"

## Key Concepts for Non-Coders

- **Game State (`g_game_state`)**: The master dictionary holding all current game information (score, lives, etc.)
- **Entity**: Any game object - ship, asteroid, enemy, bullet, etc.
- **Configuration (`Cfg`)**: Game settings that control behavior (speeds, colors, sizes)
- **Side Effects**: When a function changes something outside itself (usually documented)
- **Global (g_ prefix)**: Data accessible from anywhere in the code
- **Frame**: One update cycle of the game (60 per second)
- **Cooldown**: A timer preventing an action from happening too frequently

## Core Design Principles

### 1. Maximum Context Visibility
**Principle**: LLMs work best when they can see all dependencies and relationships.

**Implementation**:
- Modular architecture with clear imports
- Explicit dependency injection to avoid circular imports
- Configuration centralized in `config.py`
- Data structures clearly defined in `data_structures.py`

**Rationale**: Unlike humans who can hold mental models across files, LLMs benefit from explicit, visible connections.

### 2. Explicit Over Implicit
**Principle**: Every behavior should be clearly stated, not assumed.

**Implementation**:
- No "magic" - all constants extracted to `Cfg` namespace
- Type hints throughout (even if Python doesn't enforce them)
- Verbose but clear variable names (`g_game_state` not `gs`)
- Explicit state machines (see `FinisherPhase` enum)

**Rationale**: LLMs can't "just know" conventions - everything must be discoverable from the code itself.

### 3. Organized Global State
**Principle**: State that needs game-wide access should be clearly organized and documented.

**Implementation**:
- Global state grouped logically in dictionaries
- Clear prefixes (`g_` for globals)
- State documentation at point of declaration
- Immutable configuration separated from mutable state

**Rationale**: LLMs need to understand data flow without hunting through code.

### 4. Dependency Injection for Modularity
**Principle**: Avoid circular imports while maintaining modularity.

**Implementation**:
- `ProgressionSystem` class with injected dependencies
- `DrawingSystem` class with injected functions
- Clear separation of concerns

**Rationale**: Allows code organization without sacrificing LLM comprehension.

### 5. LLM-Oriented Documentation
**Principle**: All documentation exists to help LLMs understand and modify code. Humans interact through LLMs, not by reading code.

**Implementation**:
- Every function has a docstring (for LLM context, not human readers)
- Complex logic has inline comments (to prevent LLM misinterpretation)
- Side effects clearly documented (so LLMs can trace impacts)
- Global usage explicitly stated (for LLM dependency tracking)

**Rationale**: LLMs need explicit documentation to understand code relationships. Whether a human could read it is irrelevant - humans will ask the LLM to explain or modify, never read directly.

## Human-LLM Collaboration Model

### Think of It As: Manager ← → Development Team

You're not collaborating on code - you're managing a team of AI developers. They handle all technical work while you provide direction and quality control.

### Human Manager Responsibilities
1. **Product Vision**
   - "I want a game that feels like classic Asteroids but more modern"
   - "Players should feel powerful but not invincible"
   - "Each level should feel noticeably different"

2. **Quality Assurance**
   - Play the game and report issues
   - Describe what feels wrong or right
   - Prioritize what needs fixing

3. **Strategic Decisions**
   - "Focus on polish before new features"
   - "Performance matters more than graphics"
   - "Ship it when it's fun, not perfect"

**Remember**: You manage through questions and feedback, not technical directives.

### LLM Developer Responsibilities
1. **All Technical Implementation**
   - Write, test, and debug all code
   - Maintain code structure and documentation
   - Handle all technical decisions

2. **Translation Services**
   - Convert manager vision into working features
   - Explain technical constraints in plain language
   - Provide options with trade-offs

3. **Proactive Problem Solving**
   - Identify potential issues before they occur
   - Suggest improvements based on the codebase
   - Keep code maintainable for future LLMs

## Effective Communication with Your Dev Team

### Managing Through Natural Language

As a manager, your prompts are your primary tool. Like any good manager, you need to communicate clearly about what you want, not how to build it.

### The Management Prompt Formula

**[Vision/Problem] + [Current State] + [Desired Outcome] + [Priority/Constraints]**

**Excellent Management Prompts**:
- "Players are quitting at level 3. It feels too hard too fast. Can we make the difficulty curve smoother while keeping later levels challenging?"
- "I love the explosion effects, but they're covering up the gameplay. Make them 30% smaller but keep them satisfying."
- "We need to ship by Friday. What's the minimum we need to fix to make it fun and stable?"

**Poor Management Prompts**:
- "Fix the shooting" (What's wrong with it?)
- "Make it better" (Better how? In what way?)
- "The code looks messy" (You shouldn't be looking at code!)

### Getting Great Results from Your Team

1. **Share the Why**: "Players feel overwhelmed" is better than "too many enemies"
2. **Describe the Experience**: "It feels sluggish" rather than "increase speed"
3. **Prioritize Clearly**: "Fun is more important than perfect balance"
4. **Trust Your Team**: Let them figure out the technical approach
5. **Iterate Based on Results**: Test, feedback, refine - like any development process

## Architectural Guidelines for LLMs

### Core Principle: Optimize for LLM Processing

Every architectural decision should make it easier for LLMs to:
1. Understand the current code state
2. Trace execution paths
3. Make modifications safely
4. Debug issues from vague human descriptions

### When Adding Features
1. Check if similar features exist and copy their patterns exactly
2. Add configuration to `Cfg` class with verbose, descriptive names
3. Add data structures to `data_structures.py` with clear type hints
4. Use dependency injection to make relationships explicit
5. Document for future LLMs, not humans
6. Prefer duplication over abstraction if it makes the code path clearer

### When Debugging
1. Assume the human description is vague - investigate broadly
2. Look for state management issues first
3. Trace every global access explicitly
4. Add verbose logging that future LLMs can follow
5. Never assume - verify every relationship

### When Refactoring
1. Only refactor when LLMs struggle with current structure
2. Maintain verbose, explicit style even if it seems redundant
3. Keep all documentation, even if it seems obvious
4. Update every reference, even in comments
5. Test that other LLMs can understand your changes

## Concrete Examples

### Example: Adding a Time-Slow Powerup

**Human Request**: "Add a powerup that slows down time for everything except the player"

**What the Human Sees**: A new powerup appears with a clock symbol, when collected everything moves in slow motion except their ship

**LLM Implementation** (Human never sees this):
1. Add to `PowerUpType` enum in data_structures.py
2. Configure appearance in config.py powerup_types
3. Add duration constant to config.py  
4. Add `time_slow_active` to ShipState
5. Implement time scaling logic in main.py update functions
6. Test that all systems respect the time scale

### Example: Debugging Report

**Human Report**: "When I collect a shield then dash, the shield disappears. It should stay active during the dash."

**What the Human Sees**: The problem gets fixed in the next version

**LLM Investigation** (Human never sees this):
1. Check dash execution for powerup clearing
2. Trace shield_active through dash sequence
3. Look for inappropriate state resets
4. Verify timer decrements during dash
5. Fix the issue and confirm with testing

### Example: Performance Issue

**Human Report**: "The game starts stuttering badly when there are lots of explosions"

**Good Follow-up Prompts**:
- "Can you make explosions less demanding while keeping them visually satisfying?"
- "What are my options for improving performance when many things explode at once?"
- "Should we limit how many explosions can happen simultaneously?"

**Bad Follow-up Prompts**:
- "I think the particle system is inefficient"
- "Maybe we need to optimize the explosion function"
- "Can you show me the performance profiler?"

**What the Human Sees**: Smoother gameplay with explosions that still look good

## Module Structure Rationale

### Why These Modules? (LLM Context Management)
- **config.py**: All constants in one place - LLMs can modify gameplay without touching logic
- **data_structures.py**: Type definitions prevent LLM confusion about data shapes
- **particle_system.py**: Self-contained system LLMs can ignore when working on other features
- **sound_system.py**: Optional system - LLMs can skip if not working on sound
- **visual_effects.py**: Pure rendering - LLMs know changes here won't break gameplay
- **progression_system.py**: Complex state management isolated from frame-by-frame logic
- **drawing_system.py**: Rendering isolation prevents LLMs from mixing draw and update logic
- **main.py**: Central coordination - LLMs start here to understand flow

### When to Create New Modules (LLM-Centric Decision)
Create a new module when:
1. Current files exceed LLM token limits for reliable editing
2. A system can be completely ignored when working on other features
3. Multiple LLMs working simultaneously need isolation
4. The abstraction boundary is so clear that no cross-file understanding is needed

Never create a module for:
1. "Clean architecture" - this is meaningless to LLMs
2. "Reusability" - copy-paste is fine for LLM development
3. "Separation of concerns" unless it reduces LLM cognitive load
4. Small helpers that would force LLMs to jump between files

## Testing Guidance for Humans

### Your Role: Play the Game, Report Issues

You test by playing, never by reading code. Your job is to describe what you experience.

### What to Look For
1. **Visual Issues**: "The explosion doesn't look right"
2. **Feel Issues**: "The controls feel sluggish"
3. **Balance Issues**: "Level 5 is too hard"
4. **Crash Issues**: "It freezes when I do X then Y"

### How to Report Issues
1. Describe what you did: "I collected a shield then dashed"
2. Describe what happened: "The shield disappeared"
3. Describe what you expected: "The shield should stay active"
4. Note any patterns: "This happens every time"

### What NOT to Do
- Never mention function names or variables
- Never suggest code changes
- Never ask to see code
- Never try to debug yourself

**Remember**: You're the game director, not a programmer. Describe the problem as a player would, and let the LLM handle all technical aspects.

## Architecture Evolution

### From Single-File to Modular (The Reality)

This project began as a single-file architecture - not by accident, but by design. Single-file development with LLMs was remarkably smooth: everything was visible, context was complete, and modifications were straightforward.

**Why We Modularized**: At 5,500+ lines and 200KB+, we hit a practical limit. LLMs could still *read* the entire file, but they struggled to *update* it effectively. The modularization was a necessary compromise, not an improvement.

**The Trade-off**:
- **Lost**: Simplicity, complete context visibility, ease of modification
- **Gained**: Ability to continue development, manageable file sizes
- **Reality**: We now face increased complexity, but development is possible again

This evolution demonstrates an important principle: **structure serves LLM capability limits, not architectural ideals**. As LLM context windows and editing capabilities improve, we may return to a single-file approach.

## When LLMs Get Stuck

### Your Safety Net: Version Control
The project uses git source control. If LLMs encounter a problem they cannot solve after multiple attempts, you don't need to break the "no code" principle. Instead:

1. **Revert**: Go back to the last working version
2. **Rethink**: Approach the feature differently
3. **Retry**: Give LLMs a new angle or simpler goal

This maintains our core principle while ensuring the project never gets permanently stuck.

### Before Reverting, Try These Steps
1. **Clarify**: Ensure you've described the problem with specific examples
2. **Break Down**: Ask for smaller, incremental changes instead of big features
3. **Ask for Options**: "What are three different ways we could approach this?"
4. **Simplify**: "Let's do a simpler version first and improve it later"

### When to Revert
If after 3-4 attempts:
- The game is broken and LLMs can't fix it
- A feature causes more problems than it solves
- Performance degrades beyond playability

**Remember**: Reverting isn't failure - it's smart project management. Every revert teaches you how to better communicate with your LLM team.

## Future Considerations

### Scaling the Approach
As the codebase grows:
1. Maintain the explicit documentation
2. Consider more aggressive modularization only when LLMs struggle
3. Add integration tests that LLMs can run
4. Build debugging tools into the game

### Technology Evolution
As LLMs improve:
1. Context windows will grow - we may return to single file when feasible
2. Multi-file reasoning will improve - current modular structure may become seamless
3. Tool use will expand - perhaps automated testing and deployment

### The Ideal Future
When LLM capabilities allow, the optimal structure for this development model would be:
- Single file for maximum context
- 10,000+ lines without issues
- Complete visibility of all relationships
- No cognitive overhead from modularization

## Signs You're Managing LLM Developers Well

### You Know You're Succeeding When:

1. **You never need to look at code** - Your requests and their explanations are sufficient
2. **Features get implemented correctly** from natural language descriptions
3. **Bugs get fixed** from your play-testing descriptions
4. **You get thoughtful options** when asking for changes
5. **The game improves** based on your vision, not technical constraints

### Red Flags to Watch For:

1. **You feel tempted to look at code** - Your prompts may be too vague
2. **LLMs ask you technical questions** - Redirect to outcomes, not implementation
3. **Features don't match your vision** - Clarify with examples and feelings
4. **Bugs persist after reporting** - Provide more specific reproduction steps
5. **Development stalls** - Break down large requests into smaller pieces

### The Ultimate Test

Can you describe your entire game vision, have LLMs build it, test it by playing, request changes based on feel, and ship a fun game - all without ever seeing a single line of code? If yes, you're managing your LLM dev team effectively.

**Remember**: Reverting isn't failure - it's smart project management. Every revert teaches you how to better communicate with your LLM team.

This codebase represents a fundamental shift in how software is created and maintained. **Humans never read or write code** - they express desires and evaluate results. **LLMs are the sole developers**, reading, writing, and debugging all code.

The architecture serves one master: **LLM comprehension**. Every decision - from verbose variable names to explicit documentation to modular structure - exists to make it easier for LLMs to understand and modify the code. Traditional software engineering principles are irrelevant except where they coincidentally align with LLM needs.

Most importantly, this philosophy is pragmatic: we modularized not because it's "good architecture," but because current LLMs couldn't reliably edit 5,500+ line files. When LLM capabilities improve, we should return to whatever structure makes LLM development most effective, regardless of traditional software engineering dogma.

**The ultimate test of any architectural decision**: Does it make it easier for an LLM to understand and modify the code when given vague human instructions? If not, it's wrong for this project, no matter how "correct" it might be in traditional development.
